# IST-687
This was the first class I took during my Master's program. It's fairly rudimentary. The data used is from the PGA tour from
2010-2018, from kaggle user: url : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jmpark746/pga-tour-data-2010-2018?resource=download
In this project, I begin by collecting and cleaning the data, followed by some simple data exploration and visualization.
Eventually, SVM, linear modeling, and decision trees were used to find out which attributes are most important for becoming
a successful PGA player. Much more can be found in the report.
